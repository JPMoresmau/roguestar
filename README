Roguestar: Meta-Package / Maintainer's Package README
=====================================================

This git repository contains all of the packages that make up roguestar.

The binary packages:

* roguestar-engine
* roguestar-gl
* rsagl-demos

And the library packages:

* rsagl (RogueStar Animation and Graphics Library)

The library packages must be installed before the binary packages can
even be configured.

Maintainer Scripts
------------------

To facilitate maintenance, there is a `Makefile` that contains
numerous convenient maintainer scripts.

Unfortunately, cabal doesn't seem to be reliable enough when used
with `--package-db` to consistantly get roguestar to build and install
from scratch in a throwaway directory without touching the user's `~/.cabal`.

Installing the libraries is a 3-phase process, corresponding to the numbers
at the end of ACTION-libsN.  These phases must be run in order.  Usually
you don't want to do this, just run 'make install-libs'.

The makefile accepts the following actions:

install-deps  [-e OPTS=cabal install opts]
:             use cabal to install all dependencies not in the
:             haskell-platform.

clean         [-e OPTS=cabal clean opts]
:             restore everything to a pristine state

clean-bin     [-e OPTS=cabal clean opts]
:             clean the binaries

config-libsN  [-e OPTS=cabal configure opts]
:             (re)configure the libraries
:             by default, uses --user

config-bin    [-e OPTS=cabal configure opts]
:             (re)configure the binaries
:             by default, uses --user
:             by default, the prefix is ./roguestar-local

build-libsN   [-e OPTS=cabal build opts]
:             build the libraries

build-bin     [-e OPTS=cabal build opts]
:             build the binaries

copy-libsN    [-e OPTS=cabal copy/register opts]
:             copy and register the libraries
:             by default, they will end up in your ~/.cabal

copy-bins     [-e OPTS=cabal copy opts]
:             copy the binaries
:             by default, they will end up in your ./roguestar-local

install-libs  [-e OPTS=cabal install opts]
:             install the libraries
:             this uses cabal install, and overrides the configuration step
:             by default, they will end up in your ~/.cabal
:             by default, uses --reinstall

install-bins  [-e OPTS=cabal install opts]
:             install the binaries
:             this uses cabal install, and overrides the configuration step
:             by default, uses --reinstall

install       [-e OPTS=cabal install opts]
:             install everything
:             this uses cabal install, and overrides the configuration step

from-scratch  (uses default opts)
:             clean, configure, build, and copy the whole thing

from-libs     (uses default opts)
:             rebuild and install the libs, clean, configure, build, and copy the binaries

sdist         [-e OPTS=cabal sdist opts]
:             perform a cabal sdist, and gather everything under roguestar-sdist
